I've been supporting my wife's business by keeping her events business (Local Family Events)[https://localfamily.events] up and running.  I was avoiding using ReactJS due to insufficient SEO behaviour.  I did breifly try to pull data from the existing site to an (SPA-prototype)[https://vercel.com/planethurley/lfe/6mozRfyiUy3oTd7pUMQV26uAyZKd] using React just to see what I could do.

About a year ago I learned of (NextJS)[https://nextjs.org/] by (Vercel)[https://vercel.com/].  Recently I've started learning this framework through it's simple and clear tutorials and can see it appears to have enough SEO support now, so I will be trying this very soon.
