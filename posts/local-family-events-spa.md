title: Concept of rewriting SSR .Net website into SPA using ReactJS and Redux

I've been supporting my wife's [Local Family Events](https://localfamily.events) business by keeping her Asp.Net Core website up and running.  I was avoiding using ReactJS due to insufficient SEO behaviour.  I did briefly try to pull data from the existing site to an [SPA-prototype](https://lfe-planethurley.vercel.app/) using React just to see what I could do and it all would work well, but I stopped very quickly when I realised the SEO capabilities in React was limited.

About a year ago I heard about [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).  So a few weeks ago I finally had some time to start learning this React *Framework* by using their [simple and clear tutorials](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) and I quickly saw it has plenty of SEO support!  So I will be trying to port the ASP.Net Core site to NextJS as I much prefer the speed of frontend development and the fantastic hosting tooling and capabilities of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
